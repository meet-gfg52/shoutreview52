in agile SDLF
1. Product requirements
2. There will be spike ( a poc for the demo and approvals)
3. refine requirements - breaks it into epic ( epic - big milestones to be achieved for whole product)
4. Design diagram
    Arch related diagrams
       1. Activity diagram
       2. flow diagrams
       3. High level design
       4. LLD -> SDE 3 to arch involved
               entities
               Schema
               APIs

       5. API contracts
              Endpoint
              Request
              Response
              Scenario : ex: swagger of API

       6. one epic is picked per quater
            epic have multiple backlogs ( backlogs = small milestones to complete the epic) 30
            sprint - 15 days or 30 days or 10 days
            5 stories per sprint ( 5 backlogs will be taken as stories)

            Each Story:
                1. Information
                2. timeline
                3. story points
                4. Acceptance criteria

       backend developers: each stories can be assiged to each developer to work on for a sprint.

       backend devs: SDE1/2 or 3 -> each stories can broken into tasks ->
            a small change page


       scrum -> each day each developer explains the progress of stories.



       On sprint end. acceptance criteria are matched with work evidance.
       Either story completes or close
       or spilled.

       Retrospective of sprint:  discuss and fix the short comings in the previous sprint.
